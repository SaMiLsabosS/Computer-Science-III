I don’t like cats and they don’t like me.
I used to be allergic to them and I would get stuffed up and have hives.
That doesn’t seem to happen anymore.
But I still don’t like them.
I lived with 3 cats that were not good at peeing in the litter box.
They seemed to find something important to me and pee on it.
Most of the time they peed on photographs or papers that would be ruined.
Cats also bring fleas into the house.
There is nothing worse than having to flea dip cats and also flea bomb a home.
That is why I don’t like cats.

I inadvertently went to See's Candy last week (I was in the mall looking for phone repair), and as it turns out, See's Candy now charges a dollar -- a full dollar -- for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings.
I bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolate-caramel-almond things.
The total cost was four-something.
I mean, the candies were tasty and all, but let's be real: A Snickers bar is fifty cents.
After this dollar-per-candy revelation, I may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a See's Candy any time soon.

Sometimes it's just better not to be seen.
That's how Harry had always lived his life.
He prided himself as being the fly on the wall and the fae that blended into the crowd.
That's why he was so shocked that she noticed him.
